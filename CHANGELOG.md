#Changelog

## Next version
- Fast mode #4: Introduced the new mode which increases the speed of input. Fast mode enables the user to populate EditText fields using focus change and click events.
- Configuration file variables support #1: Added support for variables in configuration file. Now we are able to use device information (Device model, Android version, IP Address etc.) as input for EditText fields. Using random values is easier and more flexible than before.

## v0.1.0
